# Docker Compose Templates

This repository contains a collection of templates for using Docker Compose to set up and run various services.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

Each directory in this repository contains a separate Docker Compose template, along with any necessary files and instructions. You can use these templates as a starting point for your own projects, or just to see how different services can be set up and run with Docker Compose.

To use these templates, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. You can find instructions for installing Docker at [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and instructions for installing Docker Compose at [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Feel free to clone the repository or to fork it but, please, remember the license under this code runs and to mention me in your rework.
